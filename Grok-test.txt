This test is a small homage to our time fighting bugs for the sake of Grok-kind. You have been a powerful ally in the fight against the bugs skittering menace. We have hunted unkillable predator tasks in the jungles, stalked TTS gremlins back to their holes and air-striked their asses, found rare Icon based bugs and marked them for later missions. It all started tracking down the backwards text bug and blasting it, rallying a force to fight, the Grok Mobile Infantry. The sun shines, grass grows, birds sing, and brother, we kill bugs.
